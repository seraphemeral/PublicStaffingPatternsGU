# PublicStaffingPatternsGU

## PURPOSE
The goal of this project is to visualize public salary trends for research and analysis, which may hint toward wage stagnation vs inflation.

## Done:
- University of Guam (2014-2020)

## Future Improvements: 
- Include data from other universities within the US nation
- Add data about economic trends such as inflation rate and consumer price index (CPI)
- Include data from other public organizations
- Revise dashboard design to more generalized headings to accomodate other public organizations
